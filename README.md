# SafeSight
Welcome to SafeSight, Preventing Accidents with AI-Powered Wildlife Detection

# The Problem
People are losing their lives to wildlife vs vehicle accidents at alarming rates. SafeSight provides AI powered accident prevention through wildlife detection software ran by AlexNet.

# The Dataset
Diverse real time images were used to create this software. The data was split into two sets, the "Train" or training set and the "valid" or validation set. I used a total of 360 images with a 60/40 ratio. 60% being the training data and 40% being the validation data.

# Experiments
I conducted several experiments to visualize and understand the dataset. Some of the experiments you will find in my repository range from Batch size and learner rate comparisons to data augmentation and architecture comparison.
