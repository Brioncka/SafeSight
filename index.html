          <h2>Why Safesight?</h2>
          <p>
            The problem is that many people lose their lives due to unsuspected deer and other wildlife
            collisions while operating their motor vehicle. My motivation behind this project is to preserve
            human life and create an opportunity for drivers to safely travel and detect wildlife on the
            roadway and avoid colliding with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Safesight explores how a computer-vision model (AlexNet) can detect wildlife on a driver’s route
            using dashcam-style images, laying the groundwork for future in-car safety systems.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Dataset</h3>
            <p>
              Around <strong>320 dashcam-style images</strong> collected from Google Images, split into two
              classes: <strong>deer</strong> and <strong>nodeer</strong>. After loading and filtering, the final
              dataset used for training contained <strong>192 training images</strong> and
              <strong>115 validation images</strong> (roughly a 60/40 split).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Model</h3>
            <p>
              Safesight uses <strong>AlexNet</strong> for binary image classification, detecting whether wildlife
              is present on a driver’s route. A <strong>pretrained AlexNet on ImageNet</strong> is fine-tuned for
              the deer vs nodeer task and compared against <strong>untrained (randomly initialized)</strong>
              AlexNet.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Performance</h3>
            <p>
              The best pretrained run (<code>pretrained_run_011</code>) reached a
              <strong>best validation accuracy of 0.9913 (≈ 99.1%)</strong>. Across runs, pretrained AlexNet
              typically achieved <strong>≈ 0.97–0.99</strong> validation accuracy, while untrained AlexNet stayed
              around <strong>≈ 0.85–0.90</strong>.

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Transfer learning works extremely well:</strong> a pretrained AlexNet dramatically
                outperforms an untrained AlexNet on a small, custom dataset.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Data quality matters:</strong> having clear, on-topic images for each class is crucial for
                reliable wildlife detection.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Experiment tracking helps:</strong> using Weights &amp; Biases made it easy to compare dozens
                of runs and clearly see the gap between pretrained and untrained models.

            <h3>Future Work</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Collect more diverse, real dashcam footage (nighttime, rain, fog) to better reflect real-world
                driving scenarios.
              </li>
              <li>
                Extend beyond binary deer/nodeer to multi-class wildlife detection (deer, elk, moose, other
                animals, no animal).
              </li>
              <li>
                Prototype an in-car or mobile app that could run a lightweight version of the model in real time
                as a driver assistance tool.
              </li>
