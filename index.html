          <h2>Why Safesight?</h2>
          <p>
            The problem is that many people lose their lives due to unsuspected deer and other wildlife
            collisions while operating their motor vehicle. My motivation behind this project is to preserve
            human life and create an opportunity for drivers to safely travel and detect wildlife on the
            roadway and avoid colliding with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Safesight explores how a computer-vision model (AlexNet) can detect wildlife on a driver’s route
            using dashcam-style images, laying the groundwork for future in-car safety systems.

    <h2>Project at a Glance</h2>
    <div class="card-grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Dataset</h3>
        <p>
          Safesight uses a small but focused custom image dataset of dashcam-style scenes.
          I collected around <strong>320 images</strong> from Google Images across two classes:
          <strong>deer</strong> and <strong>nodeer</strong>. After cleaning and loading, the final dataset
          used for training contains <strong>192 training images</strong> and
          <strong>115 validation images</strong> (roughly a 60/40 split), organized into
          <code>train/deer</code>, <code>train/nodeer</code>, <code>valid/deer</code>, and
          <code>valid/nodeer</code>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Model</h3>
        <p>
          The core model is a <strong>pretrained AlexNet</strong> adapted for binary classification
          (deer vs nodeer) by replacing the final classifier layer with two output units. I use
          <strong>transfer learning</strong> from ImageNet so the network can reuse strong visual
          features and fine-tune them on wildlife detection. For comparison, I also trained an
          <strong>untrained AlexNet</strong> (random initialization) and a deeper
          <strong>ResNet18</strong> model on the same dataset.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Performance</h3>
        <p>
          Experiments were tracked with <strong>Weights &amp; Biases (W&amp;B)</strong> to compare
          batch sizes, learning rates, data augmentation, and architectures:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Best pretrained AlexNet:</strong> validation accuracy up to
            <strong>0.9826 (≈ 98.3%)</strong> with batch size 16, learning rate 0.0001, and augmentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Typical strong AlexNet runs:</strong> validation accuracy in the
            <strong>0.96–0.98</strong> range with batch sizes 32 and 64 at learning rate 0.0001.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Untrained AlexNet:</strong> training from scratch on the same data reached only
            about <strong>0.80 (80%)</strong> validation accuracy, showing the benefit of transfer learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ResNet18 (pretrained):</strong> achieved <strong>1.00 (100%)</strong> validation
            accuracy with very low validation loss, slightly outperforming AlexNet on this task.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Overall, the results suggest that pretrained convolutional networks, especially ResNet18, can
          reliably detect deer vs nodeer even with a relatively small, real-world style dataset.

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Transfer learning works extremely well:</strong> a pretrained AlexNet dramatically
                outperforms an untrained AlexNet on a small, custom dataset.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Data quality matters:</strong> having clear, on-topic images for each class is crucial for
                reliable wildlife detection.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Experiment tracking helps:</strong> using Weights &amp; Biases made it easy to compare dozens
                of runs and clearly see the gap between pretrained and untrained models.

            <h3>Future Work</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Collect more diverse, real dashcam footage (nighttime, rain, fog) to better reflect real-world
                driving scenarios.
              </li>
              <li>
                Extend beyond binary deer/nodeer to multi-class wildlife detection (deer, elk, moose, other
                animals, no animal).
              </li>
              <li>
                Prototype an in-car or mobile app that could run a lightweight version of the model in real time
                as a driver assistance tool.
